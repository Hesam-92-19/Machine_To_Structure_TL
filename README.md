# Machine_To_Structure_TL

This repo reproduces the results of MSSP article "Transferring Damage Detection Knowledge Across Rotating Machines and Framed Structures: Harnessing Domain Adaptation and Contrastive Learning", studying the possibility of leveraging fault detection knowledge from rottaing machinery to frame structures. Two Jupyter notebooks are offered here, one ("CL-Training.ipynb") to train your models on the rottaing machinery (RM) dataset that can be stored for later accuracy estimation aside from the pre-trained models we used to write that article. The "SDD-Inference" notebook, step-by-step produces all outcomes of the paper and you can find  coding details in the "Ytils.py" file. lease do not hesitate to contact me (soleimanisam92@g.ucla.edu) for any question you may encounter. Thank you.

If you want to try out the Notebboks in Google colab you may:
